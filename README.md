# odin-landing-page

A simple single page website styled with CSS using flexbox and other learnings from the Odin Project - [Project: Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

We are given a [Design Brief](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png) and need to replciate the page as closely as possible. This is my attempt.
